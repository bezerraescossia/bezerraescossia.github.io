I am a passionate Data Specialist with deep expertise in Data Engineering and Data Science. My enthusiasm for analytics, combined with a solid foundation in statistics and mathematics, drives my commitment to leveraging data for impactful solutions. Over the years, I have been involved in large-scale data infrastructure projects at a global level, working with major companies to develop, implement, and maintain systems that ingest raw data and generate high-quality, consistent information.

With certifications in cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS, as well as professional certifications in Data Engineering and Data Science from IBM, I have honed my skills in cloud technologies, data integration, and big data frameworks. My technical experience spans working with tools like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Kubernetes, Docker, and ETL technologies, among others.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am particularly interested in the financial sector, where I aim to apply my data analytics skills to help drive business growth and innovation. I see vast potential in using data science to optimize financial processes, improve risk management, and enhance customer experience.
